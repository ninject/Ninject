If you are trying to build for a particular platform, please download and install the respective SDKs:   
    .NET Compact Framework 3.5, you need .NET Compact Framework 3.5 Redistributable - http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e3821449-3c6b-42f1-9fd9-0041345b3385
    Microsoft® Silverlight™ 2 SDK: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8d933343-038f-499c-986c-c3c7e87a60b3
    Microsoft® Silverlight™ 3 SDK: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1ea49236-0de7-41b1-81c8-a126ff39975b
    Microsoft® Silverlight™ 4 SDK: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=7335
    Microsoft® Silverlight™ 5 SDK: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28359
    Microsoft® Silverlight™ 5 Runtime: Download depending on your OS from: http://www.silverlight.net/downloads - End-User Runtime is sufficient, though the Developer Runtime will work as well.
    Microsoft® Windows Phone SDK 7.1: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=27570
    Mono 2.X : http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html

If you like to work with the "Ninject with Silverlight and WP7 Unittesting.sln" Visual Studio Solution you additionally have to install the following:
    Microsoft® Silverlight™ 5 Tools for VS2010 SP1: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=28358
    (it already contains Microsoft® Silverlight™ 5 SDK and Microsoft® Silverlight™ 5 Developer Runtime, so you can skip these above)
	
The rest of this file is only needed if you are running the NAnt scripts provided.

If you do not need to run Microsoft® Silverlight™ unit tests, simply pass "-D:skip.silverlightTests=true" in the build command to skip them.

If you would like to run Microsoft® Silverlight™ tests, you need to allow the creation of a local service host and need to follow the steps 
outlined below (unless you run the scripts as Administrator).
Before building the first time you have to perform the following steps:
1. Run cmd.exe as Administrator.
2. Enter the following command in the command prompt putting in your own domain and user name:
   netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8887/ user=DOMAIN\user
   or this should do it for you
   netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8887/ user=%UserDomain%\%UserName%

3. If it worked, you should see "URL reservation successfully added" in the command window.
